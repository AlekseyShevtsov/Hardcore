This, this is the way
This is the way I want to live
I'm going through changes
This is the way I want to live

From this day one no one going tell you
What I should do and what I should not
That ain't the way, the way that it shall be
Fight it all the way
So let them vultures prey on each other
Don't let them spoil it you've come this far
Coming out like a force of nature
This is the shape of things to come

This, this is the way
This is the way I want to live
I'm going through changes (coming up, coming up)
This is the way I want to live
This, this is the way
This is the way I want to live
I'm going through changes (coming up, coming up)
This is the way I want to live
